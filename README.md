Neonium is a fork of Vintagium by Asek3 which itself is a fork of Sodium for Forge 1.12.2 by CaffeineMC.

The main goal of Neonium is to provide the best performance improvements possible for Minecraft 1.12.2 while maintaining compatibility with other mods.

## 📢 Disclaimer
Known incompatibilities:
- Optifine (Neonium is not and will never be compatible with Optifine)
- FarPlaneTwo
- LittleTiles
- Fluidlogged API (and other mods that use this API, such as Subaquatic)
- ArchitectureCraft

Due to limited time, feature requests are best made through pull requests. I'll review them as soon as possible.
