Neonium is a fork of [Vintagium by Asek3](https://github.com/Asek3/sodium-1.12), which itself is a fork of [CaffeineMC's "Sodium"](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium), ported to Minecraft 1.12.2 and designed to work with Forge Mod Loader.

Neonium's main goal is to provide the best performance improvements possible for Minecraft 1.12.2 while maintaining compatibility with other mods.

## 📢 Disclaimer
Known incompatibilities:
- Optifine (Neonium is not and will never be compatible with Optifine)
- FarPlaneTwo (Neonium will not have any support for FarPlaneTwo)
- Nothirium (Feature conflicts because this mod uses similar optimization methods)
- Hardcore Darkness (Neonium is not and will most likely not be compatible with Hardcore Darkness)
- Cleanroom Loader (Neonium will not support Cleanroom loader and any incompatibilities in it)

Due to limited time, feature requests are best made through pull requests. I'll review them as soon as possible.
