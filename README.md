Neonium is a fork of [Vintagium by Asek3](https://github.com/Asek3/sodium-1.12), which itself is a fork of [CaffeineMC's "Sodium"](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium), ported to Minecraft 1.12.2 and designed to work with Forge Mod Loader.

The main goal of Neonium is to provide the best performance improvements possible for Minecraft 1.12.2 while maintaining compatibility with other mods.

## üì¢ Disclaimer
Known incompatibilities:
- Optifine (Neonium is not and will never be compatible with Optifine)
- FarPlaneTwo
- LittleTiles

Due to limited time, feature requests are best made through pull requests. I'll review them as soon as possible.
